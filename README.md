# Hannas flutter calculator

A Flutter calculator created for the `FITech 101: Mobiilisovellukset ja niiden luominen` course

This project is my first Flutter application.


## Run locally

Run the app easily in vs code by selecting a target device from the status bar and by clicking `Run`and `Run Without Debugging`.

The app can be run on Chrome or some other browser if no ios or android emulator is available on your device.

I reccomend using `Inspect` and changing screen to phone dimensions.


## Tests

Tests will be added in the future.
